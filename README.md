# Pacific Duct Pros - Backend Setup Guide

## ⚠️ After editing any HTML class, rebuild the stylesheet

The site no longer loads Tailwind from a CDN — the pages link a prebuilt
`public/tailwind.css`, which is what makes them render instantly on mobile.
That file is generated from the classes found in `public/**`, so a class you
add to the HTML has no styling until you rebuild:

```bash
npm run build:css
```

Use `npm run watch:css` while editing to rebuild automatically. The theme
(colours, spacing, fonts) lives in `tailwind.config.js`, and the built file is
committed so Vercel can serve it without a build step.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) installed
- Gmail account (or any SMTP email service)
- Basic knowledge of terminal/command prompt

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Node.js Dependencies

Open terminal in the `DuctCleaning` folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages:
- express (web server)
- nodemailer (email sending)
- cors (cross-origin requests)
- body-parser (form data parsing)
- dotenv (environment variables)

---

### Step 2: Configure Email Settings

1. **Open `.env` file** in the project folder

2. **For Gmail Users:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Enable 2-Step Verification first
   - Generate an "App Password" for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Update `.env` file:**

```env
PORT=3000
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx  # Your App Password (remove spaces)
ADMIN_EMAIL=info@pacificductpros.com   # Where bookings will be sent
```

**Example:**
```env
PORT=3000
EMAIL_USER=info@pacificductpros.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcdwxyzpqrs1234
ADMIN_EMAIL=info@pacificductpros.com
```

---

### Step 3: Start the Server

Run this command:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server is running on http://localhost:3000
📧 Email service configured with: your-email@gmail.com
```

---

### Step 4: Test the Backend

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/test
```

You should see:
```json
{"message": "Backend is working!"}
```

---

## 📧 Email Services Supported

### Gmail (Recommended)
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Outlook/Hotmail
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

### Yahoo Mail
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Custom SMTP
Edit `server.js` and replace the transporter configuration:
```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.yourdomain.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
  }
});
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Form

1. **Start the server:** `npm start`
2. **Open:** `code.html` in your browser
3. **Fill the booking form** and submit
4. **Check your email** - you should receive:
   - Admin notification (booking details)
   - Customer confirmation email

---

## 🔧 Development Mode

For auto-restart on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when you make changes.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid login credentials"
- Make sure you're using an **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- Enable 2-Step Verification in Gmail first

### Error: "Port 3000 already in use"
- Change `PORT=3000` to `PORT=3001` in `.env` file
- Update the form URL in `code.html` accordingly

### Emails not sending
- Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in EMAIL_PASS
- Try sending a test email from Gmail web to verify account works

### CORS errors
- Make sure server is running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Check browser console for specific error messages
